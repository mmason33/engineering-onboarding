# Envoy Engineering Onboarding

Welcome to the Envoy Group Engineering team, we're excited you're here and can't wait to get you started building amazing things! At Envoy we want to make sure you have everything to be successful, inspired and happy.

### Your First Week
Your first week will be filled with mostly meetings and adminstrative information. You'll meet with each department in the company to get an overview of how Envoy works as a whole. Don't be discouraged if you're not immediately punching keys and pushing code. Depending on the current projects, timelines and clients it can take some time to appropriately integrate you into the workflow.

### 1-on-1(s)
You'll have scheduled time with two of our engineers during your first week. We'll have you meet with both a front-end and back-end focused engineer from our team. This time has no agenda, it's time for you to get to know the other engineers, ask questions and learn about the projects they're working on. It will be scheduled on the calendar to allow for proper resourcing and time managment but the session will be entirely informal.

### Team Lunch
Expect to go out to a killer lunch with the engineering team your first week! We want to welcome you and get to know you better!

### Engineering Inovation
At Envoy we always do our best to stay current and up to date with latest tools and technologies. There's a lot of freedom and opportunity to invovate and utilize new technologies. We want to hear about all of your ideas and interests.

### Personal Development
At Envoy we encourage you to continue learning and growing. We understand you may have interests (Machine Learning for example) that may not directly translate to our current projects but we want to allow you the freedom to pursue your interests. There will be times for you to explore and learn a topic of your choosing. Please reach out our to direct manager if you have specific questions on this topic.
